However, that site refers to the paper by [Kiehl and Trenberth 1997](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281997%29078%3C0197%3AEAGMEB%3E2.0.CO%3B2), which clearly states that they modeled an atmosphere with a CO$_2$ concetration of 353ppm, the value in given by the IPCC in its 1990 report. \n",

He calculates $n_b$ by using the pre-industrial temperature 287K, which he asserts was the temperature in 1900, and that the concentration at that time was 280 ppm. In fact, from the data above, the temperature in 1900 was 286.8 (temperature anomaly of -0.2), and at that temperature the carbon dioxide concentration was 296 ppm, not 280 ppm.\n",
